Practicing Pointers
This C program demonstrates basic pointer usage, dynamic memory allocation with malloc(), and storing pointers in an array. It prompts the user for three integers, stores them using a mix of dynamic and stack allocation, and displays them as an "array" by dereferencing an array of pointers.

This program is will be updated as I practice more.
